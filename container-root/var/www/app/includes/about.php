<h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
Php-Syslog-ng is a front-end for viewing syslog-ng messages logged to MySQL in real-time. It lets you quickly and easily manage logs from many hosts. It features customized searches based on host, facility, priority, date, time and the content of the log messages. It also has a tail mode and allows for customized filters that enable you to monitor your systmes in near real-time. The latest version of Php-Syslog-ng requires MySQL 5.0 or later for full functionality. Older versions of MySQL are still supported but the functionality will be somewhat limited. Any recent version of syslog-ng, Apache and PHP should work.

2002-07-31 - Michael Earls releases version 0.1 of Php-Syslog-ng. 
More information can be found at http://www.vermeer.org/projects/Php-Syslog-ng and http://sourceforge.net/projects/Php-Syslog-ng/ <i>But please be aware that these versions are old and no longer maintained.</i>

<p>
Michael Earls steadily improved on Php-Syslog-ng until his last release (2.5.1) in the summer of 2004.

<p>
After that I think the main contributor was Jason Taylor (<a href="http://deathstar.com/PhpSyslogNG">http://deathstar.com/PhpSyslogNG</a>). The development since Michael Earls' last release can be followed on the mailing list on sourceforge (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=Php-Syslog-ng-support">http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=Php-Syslog-ng-support</a>). (Note: The Sourceforge list is in the process of being deprecated in favor of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-syslog-ng">Google's Code Repository</a>

<p>
Php-Syslog-ng May 2005 (2.5.3)<br />
I had been looking at this project and others like it for a while and I needed to implement something like this at work. That gave me the excuse to finally take a good look at the code for Php-Syslog-ng to see if it matched my requirements. I downloaded Jason Taylor's 20050422 release and started to dig in. It quickly became apparent that the code could use some clean-up work before I would start to add any new features. The clean-up was a little more work than I had first hoped but after a couple of days I had some code that I thought was work-able. I then started adding/fixing some of the things I immediately wanted done. The most significant change is that MySQL 4.0 is now required if you want full functionality (earlier versions are still supported with limited functionality). I don't know how well my approach to calculating the total number of results works in a very busy environment but I believe that it will be OK. This is something I will keep an eye on as I implement this system where I work.<br> (note from cdukes: I don't know who wrote this?)

<p>
Php-Syslog-ng May 2005 (2.5.4)<br />
User authentication, support for multiple tables with log data and improved log rotation capabilities ... those are the main changes in this version. I also fixed a couple of bugs, added input validation for must user supplied values and further cleaned up and commented the code.<br />
Enjoy! (note from cdukes: I don't know who wrote this?)

<p>
Php-Syslog-ng June 2005 (2.6)<br />
Three new features/changes:<br />
1) Most of the work has been done towards supporting other databases. The base functionality can be ported to any database by just editing a few database related functions in common_funcs.php.<br />
2) A cache function has been implemented to remove/minimize the delay when loading the search page.<br />
3) Basic access controls have been implemented. They currently only affect the configure page but I plan on expanding it to also allow for restrictions on what searches a user can make (what hosts, timeframe etc).<br />
In addition to the new stuff I also fixed a few minor bugs. (note from cdukes: I don't know who wrote this?)

<p>
Php-Syslog-ng June 2005 (2.7)<br />
This release only has bug fixes. See the changelog for the list of changes.<br />
If you are using the merge table then you need to use MySQL 4.0.18 or later. (note from cdukes: I don't know who wrote this?)

<p>
Php-Syslog-ng July 2005 (2.8)<br />
A quick bug fix to remedy a problem in logrotate.php. (note from cdukes: I don't know who wrote this?)
