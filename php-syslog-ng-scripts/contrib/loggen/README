# Tests
# The loggen program is from syslog-ng. You can use it to insert large amounts of data for testing
# More info here: http://bazsi.blogs.balabit.com/2007/12/syslog-ng-fun-with-performance.html
# 
# The generate-logs.sh is just a sample shell file to show you how to run loggen
#
# The  find_missing_sequences.pl file can be run after inserting data using loggen to see if any sequences were missed.
# Note that you *should* run loggen from a remote system to truly test this since you would want to include any potential ethernet drops.
#
#
# Sample process:
# 1. copy "loggen" to another linux host
# 2. from that host, run:
#
# # The following command will generate:
# # 50 messages per second
# # using TCP stream
# # for one minute (60 seconds)
# # on port 5000 (check /etc/syslog-ng.conf to make sure it's listening)
# # to the "loghost" server (make an /etc/hosts entry or replace with the IP address)
#
# ./loggen -r 50 -S --interval 60 loghost 5000
#
# Finally, run:
# ./find_missing_sequences.pl
# to find any missing sequences.
# According to Bazsi, you should be able to get 68,000 messages per second which is essentially wire speed (100Mb)
